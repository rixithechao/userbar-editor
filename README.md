# userbar-editor
A userbar creation package for the Unity editor.  It's primarily built with the talkhaus' annual Mosts event in mind, but the package should be flexible enough for more general needs. 

To use, modify the instances in the scene as needed and then just screencap the Game view at 1x zoom and paste into your image editor of choice.

General tips/known issues:
- Needless to say, having a general familiarity with the Unity engine (the UI system especially) is recommended
- Sometimes when tabbing into Unity or saving the scene or project, the text turns solid black.  To fix this, just play and stop the project.
